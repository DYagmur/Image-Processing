# Serial Number Recognition System

This project is a Python-based system that uses a camera to capture images and performs serial number detection on the captured frames. The recognized serial numbers are then printed on the screen.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Tesseract OCR library (`pip install pytesseract`)
- Camera connected to your system

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Install the required dependencies by executing the following commands:


## Usage

1. Connect a camera to your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Python script using the following command:




4. The camera feed will open, and the system will continuously capture frames and perform serial number detection on each frame.

5. The recognized serial numbers will be printed on the screen.

6. Press 'q' on the keyboard to exit the program.

## Customization

- You can modify the code to adjust the camera settings, such as resolution or frame rate, by referring to the OpenCV documentation.

- Additional preprocessing techniques can be implemented to enhance the image quality and improve OCR accuracy. Experiment with different techniques like resizing, denoising, or applying filters.

- If you encounter issues with OCR accuracy, you may need to fine-tune the OCR process or explore advanced OCR techniques or machine learning approaches.
